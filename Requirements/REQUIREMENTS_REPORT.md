<h3 align="center">Bookster.com | An Online Bookstore Website</h3>
<h4 align="center">Requirements Report</h4>

<p>We have created a easy to use website that sells books, both physical copies and e-books. Our website, Bookster also features a dynamic product page, written in PHP, data is queried from a MySQL server and returned to the users web browser. Beyond that our other requirements are a work in progress, code has been written in python to truncate PDF files as well as scrape books and book data off the internet from various sources (PDFDrive & GoodReads) which will allow us to build up a collection of books to demonstrate the website. Product categories and featured products are designed on the website but not completely functional. In the future a live chat feature will be implemented as well as a full inventory management system. The checkout process for purchasing books is not yet complete as well as the comments section on book/product pages.</p>
